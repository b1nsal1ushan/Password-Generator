# Password-Generator
This is a password generator that is made in python. It isn't much but it can generate some strong passwords. The generated password will be 8 or more than 8 characters long. It will contain Captials, small, numeric, and special characters.
You should have Python installed in your system for this application to work.
## GUI
The graphical interface is a very simple one. You just open the application, provide the paths to Python.exe and PasswordGenerator.py and then click on Generate Password and it will generate a password for you, using the password generator in python, in the text box.
Loading the paths again and again whenever you start the application can be pretty tiring. So just click on save paths when you load them, and it will save the paths in `Paths.config` to read from it the next time you open the application.
